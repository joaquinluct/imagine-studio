# Example Scene 1

This is a minimal example scene folder for the Imagine Studio project.

Contents:
- `scene.json`: simple scene description (placeholder) describing a camera and a single object.

Purpose:
- Provide a canonical location for small example scenes used by examples, tests and documentation.
- Not intended to be a full exporter; acts as a reference input for future importers and runtime samples.
