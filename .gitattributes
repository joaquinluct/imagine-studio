# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization

# =============================================================================
# ENCODING AND LINE ENDING RULES FOR IMAGINE STUDIO
# =============================================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: All text files MUST use UTF-8 encoding with BOM to prevent
# encoding issues with special characters (emojis, non-ASCII characters).
# 
# Line endings: CRLF for Windows (this is a Windows-first project)
# Git stores files with LF in repository, converts to CRLF on checkout
# 
# To fix encoding issues:
#   1. Open file in editor that supports UTF-8 with BOM
#   2. Save as UTF-8 with BOM explicitly
#   3. Run: git add --renormalize .
# =============================================================================

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout (CRLF for Windows)
