// stb_image_impl.cpp
// Implementation file for stb_image single-header library
// This file includes the implementation by defining STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION

#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"

// stb_image is now compiled into this translation unit
// Other files can include stb_image.h without the #define to use the API
